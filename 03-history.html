<h3 id="looking-at-differences">Looking at differences</h3>
<p>Let us suppose we’ve made a change to our file and not yet committed it. We can see the changes that we’ve made:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> diff journal.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>This shows the difference between the latest copy in the repository and the changes we’ve made.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-</code> means a line was deleted.<br />
</li>
<li><code>+</code> means a line was added.<br />
</li>
<li>Note that a line that has been edited is shown as a removal of the old line and an addition of the updated line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at differences between commits is one of the most common activities. The <code>diff</code> command itself has a number of <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff.html">useful options</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a more elaborate front end to the <code>diff</code> command - <a href=""><code>git difftool</code></a>. <code>git difftool</code> is used for comparing and editing files that changed between commits using common diff tools. There is a range of such tools, including emerge, kompare, meld, and vimdiff.</p>
<p>There is a range of GUI-based tools supporting looking at differences and editing files. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/">Diffmerge</a> (Free, cross-platform)</li>
<li><a href="http://winmerge.org/">WinMerge</a> - open source tool available for Windows;</li>
<li>GitHub <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/comparing-commits-across-time">Compare view</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The choice of GUI for viewing differences depends on the context in which you are working and your own preferences related to choosing tools and technologies.</p>
<h3 id="looking-at-our-history">Looking at our history</h3>
<p>To see the history of changes that we made to our repository (the most recent changes will be displayed at the top):</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> log</code></pre></div>
<p>The output shows: the commit identifier (also called revision number) which uniquely identifies the changes made in this commit, author, date, and your comment. <em>git log</em> command has many options to print information in various ways, for example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> log --relative-date</code></pre></div>
<p>Git automatically assigns an identifier (<em>COMMITID</em>) to each commit made to the repository. In order to see the changes made between any earlier commit and our current version, we can use <code>git diff</code> providing the commit identifier of the earlier commit:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> diff COMMITID</code></pre></div>
<p>And, to see changes between two commits:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> diff OLDER_COMMITID NEWER_COMMITID</code></pre></div>
<p>Using our commit identifiers we can set our working directory to contain the state of the repository as it was at any commit. So, let’s go back to the very first commit we made,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> log 
$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout COMMITID</code></pre></div>
<p>We will get something like this:</p>
<pre class="output"><code>Note: checking out &#39;21cfbdec&#39;.

You are in &#39;detached HEAD&#39; state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b new_branch_name
  
HEAD is now at 21cfbde... Initial structure and headings for the journal paper</code></pre>
<p><em>HEAD</em> is essentially a pointer which points to the branch where you currently are. We said previously that <em>master</em> is the default branch. But <em>master</em> is actually a pointer - that points to the tip of the master branch (the sequence of commits that is created by default by Git). You may think of <em>master</em> as two things: one as a pointer and one as the default branch.</p>
<p>When we checked out one of the past commits HEAD is pointing to that commit but does not point to the same thing as master any more. That is why git says You are in ‘detached HEAD’ state and advises us that if we want to make a commit now, we should create a new branch to retain these commits.</p>
<p>If we created a new commit without creating a new branch Git would not know what to do with it (since there is already a commit in master branch from the current state which we checked out c4354a…). We will get back to branches and HEAD pointer later in this tutorial.</p>
<p>If we look at <code>journal.txt</code> we’ll see it’s our very first version. And if we look at our directory,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span></code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>journal.txt</code></pre>
<p>then we see that our <code>references</code> directory is gone. But, rest easy, while it’s gone from our working directory, it’s still in our repository. We can jump back to the latest commit by doing:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout master</code></pre></div>
<p>And <code>references</code> will be there once more,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span></code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>common journal.txt</code></pre>
<p>So we can get any version of our files from any point in time. In other words, we can set up our working directory back to any stage it was when we made a commit.</p>
<h3 id="using-tags-as-nicknames-for-commit-identifiers">Using tags as nicknames for commit identifiers</h3>
<p>Commit identifiers are long and cryptic. Git allows us to create tags, which act as easy-to-remember nicknames for commit identifiers.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> tag PAPER_STUB</code></pre></div>
<p>We can list tags by doing:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> tag</code></pre></div>
<p>Now if we change our file,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> add journal.txt 
$ <span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;...&quot;</span> journal.txt</code></pre></div>
<p>We can checkout our previous version using our tag instead of a commit identifier.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout PAPER_STUB</code></pre></div>
<p>And return to the latest checkout,</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout master</code></pre></div>

<p>When do you tag? Well, whenever you might want to get back to the exact version you’ve been working on. For a paper, this might be a version that has been submitted to an internal review, or has been submitted to a conference.
