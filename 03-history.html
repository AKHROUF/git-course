<h3 id="looking-at-differences">Looking at differences</h3>
<p>We forgot to reference a second paper in the introduction section. Correct it, save the file but do not commit it yet. We can review the changes that we made using:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> diff journal.txt</code></pre>
<p>This shows the difference between the latest copy in the repository and the changes we made.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-</code> means a line was deleted.<br /></li>
<li><code>+</code> means a line was added.<br /></li>
<li>Note that a line that has been edited is shown as a removal of the old line and an addition of the updated line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at differences between commits is one of the most common activities. The <code>diff</code> command itself has a number of <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff.html">useful options</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a more elaborate front end to the <code>diff</code> command - <a href=""><code>git difftool</code></a>. <code>git difftool</code> is used for comparing and editing files that changed between commits using common diff tools. There is a range of such tools, including emerge, kompare, meld, and vimdiff.</p>
<p>There is a range of GUI-based tools supporting looking at differences and editing files. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/">Diffmerge</a> (Free, cross-platform)</li>
<li><a href="http://winmerge.org/">WinMerge</a> - open source tool available for Windows;</li>
<li>GitHub <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/comparing-commits-across-time">Compare view</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The choice of GUI for viewing differences depends on the context in which you are working and your own preferences related to choosing tools and technologies.</p>
<p>Now commit the change we made by adding the second reference:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> add journal.txt
$ <span class="kw">git</span> commit</code></pre>
<h3 id="looking-at-our-history">Looking at our history</h3>
<p>To see the history of changes that we made to our repository (the most recent changes will be displayed at the top):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> log</code></pre>
<p>The output shows: the commit identifier (also called revision number) which uniquely identifies the changes made in this commit, author, date, and your comment. <em>git log</em> command has many options to print information in various ways, for example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> log --relative-date</code></pre>
<p>Git automatically assigns an identifier (<em>COMMITID</em>) to each commit made to the repository. In order to see the changes made between any earlier commit and our current version, we can use <code>git diff</code> providing the commit identifier of the earlier commit:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> diff COMMITID</code></pre>
<p>And, to see changes between two commits:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> diff OLDER_COMMITID NEWER_COMMITID</code></pre>
<p>Using our commit identifiers we can set our working directory to contain the state of the repository as it was at any commit. So, let’s go back to the very first commit we made,</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> log 
$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout COMMITID</code></pre>
<p>We will get something like this:</p>
<pre class="output"><code>Note: checking out &#39;21cfbdec&#39;.

You are in &#39;detached HEAD&#39; state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b new_branch_name
  
HEAD is now at 21cfbde... Add title and authors</code></pre>
<p>This strange concept of the ‘detached HEAD’ is covered in the next section … just bear with me for now!</p>
<p>If we look at <code>journal.txt</code> we’ll see it’s our very first version. And if we look at our directory,</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>journal.txt</code></pre>
<p>then we see that our <code>references</code> directory is gone. But, rest easy, while it’s gone from our working directory, it’s still in our repository. We can jump back to the latest commit by doing:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout master</code></pre>
<p>And <code>references</code> will be there once more,</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span></code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>common journal.txt</code></pre>
<p>So we can get any version of our files from any point in time. In other words, we can set up our working directory back to any stage it was when we made a commit.</p>
<h3 id="the-head-and-master-pointers">The <em>HEAD</em> and <em>master</em> pointers</h3>
<p><em>HEAD</em> is essentially a pointer which points to the branch at the commit where you currently are. We said previously that <em>master</em> is the default branch. But <em>master</em> is actually a pointer - that points to the tip of the master branch (the sequence of commits that is created by default by Git). You may think of <em>master</em> as two things: one as a pointer and one as the default branch.</p>
<p>Before we checked out one of the past commits, the <em>HEAD</em> pointer was pointing to <em>master</em> i.e. the most recent commit of the master branch. After checking out one of the past commits, <em>HEAD</em> was pointing to that commit i.e. not pointing to master any more. That is what Git means by a ‘detached HEAD’ state and advises us that if we want to make a commit now, we should create a new branch to retain these commits.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/detached_head.svg" alt="Checking out a previous commit - detached head" /><p class="caption">Checking out a previous commit - detached head</p>
</div>
<p>If we created a new commit without first creating a new branch, i.e. working from the ‘detached HEAD’ these commits would not overwrite any of our existing work, but they would not belong to any branch. In order to save this work, we would need to checkout a new branch. To discard any changes we make from the detached HEAD state, we can just checkout master again.</p>
<h3 id="using-tags-as-nicknames-for-commit-identifiers">Using tags as nicknames for commit identifiers</h3>
<p>Commit identifiers are long and cryptic. Git allows us to create tags, which act as easy-to-remember nicknames for commit identifiers.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> tag PAPER_STUB</code></pre>
<p>We can list tags by doing:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> tag</code></pre>
<p>Now add a reference and commit the change:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">gedit</span> common/references.txt
$ <span class="kw">git</span> add references.txt 
$ <span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;...&quot;</span> references.txt</code></pre>
<p>We can checkout our previous version using our tag instead of a commit identifier.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout PAPER_STUB</code></pre>
<p>And return to the latest checkout,</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout master</code></pre>

<p>When do you tag? Well, whenever you might want to get back to the exact version you’ve been working on. For a paper, this might be a version that has been submitted to an internal review, or has been submitted to a conference. For code this might be when it’s been submitted to review, or has been released.</p>
