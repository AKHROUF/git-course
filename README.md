## Version control with Git

This is an introduction to using version control with Git and GitHub.
No prior experience with version control is assumed.
The material is based on the Software Carpentry lesson and the work of Aleksandra Pawlik, but has been heavily modified. 
I teach this course at the University Of Manchester - you can apply for a place on the course [here](app.manchester.ac.uk/rgit).
