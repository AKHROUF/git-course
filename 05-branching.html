<h3 id="what-is-a-branch">What is a branch?</h3>
<p>You might have noticed the term <em>branch</em> in status messages:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> status journal.txt </code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>On branch master 
nothing to commit (working directory clean)</code></pre>
<p>and when we wanted to get back to our most recent version of the repository, we used <code>git checkout master</code>.</p>
<p>Not only can our repository store the changes made to files and directories, it can store multiple sets of these, which we can use and edit and update in parallel. Each of these sets, or parallel instances, is termed a <strong>branch</strong> and <em>master</em> is Git’s default branch.</p>
<p>A new branch can be created from any commit. Branches can also be <em>merged</em> together.</p>
<p>Why is this useful? Suppose we’ve developed some software and now we want to try out some new ideas but we’re not sure yet whether we’ll keep them. We can then create a branch ‘feature1’ and keep our master branch clean. When we’re done developing the feature and we are sure that we want to include it in our program, we can merge the feature branch with the master branch. This keeps all the work-in-progress separate from the master branch, which contains tested, working code.</p>
<p>We create our branch for the new feature.</p>
<pre><code>-c1---c2---c3        master 
       \
       c4            feature1</code></pre>
<p>We can then continue developing our software in our default, or master, branch,</p>
<pre><code>-c1---c2---c3---c5---c6---c7    master
       \ 
       c4                       feature1</code></pre>
<p>And, we can work on the new feature in the feature1 branch</p>
<pre><code>-c1---c2---c3---c5---c6---c7         master 
       \
       c4---c8---c9                  feature1</code></pre>
<p>We can then merge the feature1 branch adding new feature to our master branch (main program):</p>
<pre><code>-c1---c2---c3---c5---c6---c7--c10       master
       \                      /
       c4---c8---c9----------           feature1
</code></pre>
<p>When we merge our feature1 branch with master git creates a new commit which contains merged files from master and feature1. After the merge we can continue developing. <strong>The merged branch is not deleted.</strong> We can continue developing (and making commits) in feature1 as well.</p>
<pre><code>-c1---c2---c3---c5---c6---c7--c10---c11--c12     master
       \                      / 
       c4---c8---c9---------------c13            feature1</code></pre>
<p>One popular model is to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A master branch, representing a released version of the code</li>
<li>A release branch, representing the beginnings of the next release - a branch where the code is still undergoing testing</li>
<li>Various feature and/or developer-specific branches representing work-in-progress, new features etc</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="fig/git-flow.png" alt="Git workflow (image from http://nurelm.com/our-workflow-git-flow/)" /><p class="caption">Git workflow <a href="http://nurelm.com/our-workflow-git-flow/">(image from http://nurelm.com/our-workflow-git-flow/)</a></p>
</div>
<p>There are different possible workflows when using Git for code development. If you want to learn more about workflows with Git, have a look at the <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">feature branch workflow</a>.</p>
<h3 id="branching-in-practice">Branching in practice</h3>
<p>One of our colleagues wants to contribute to the paper but is not quite sure if it will actually make a publication. So it will be safer to create a branch and carry on working on this “experimental” version of the paper in a branch rather than in the master.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout -b paperWJohn 
<span class="kw">Switched</span> to a new branch <span class="st">&#39;paperWJohn&#39;</span></code></pre>
<p>Now let’s change the title of our paper and the authors (adding John Smith). Let’s commit our changes. Before we do that, it’s a good practice to check whether we’re working in the correct branch.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> branch </code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>  master
* paperWJohn </code></pre>
<p>The * indicates which branch we’re currently in. Let’s commit. If we want to work now in our master branch. We can switch by using:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout master </code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Switched to branch &#39;master&#39;</code></pre>
<h3 id="merging-and-resolving-conflicts">Merging and resolving conflicts</h3>
<p>We are now working on two papers: the main one in our master branch and the one which may possibly be collaborative work in our “paperWJohn” branch. Let’s change the title of the paper in the collaborative branch to reflect the new content that this version will contain. Let’s do it and commit changes.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout paperWJohn
$ <span class="kw">gedit</span> journal.txt
$ <span class="kw">git</span> add journal.txt 
$ <span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Change title&quot;</span> journal.txt</code></pre>
<p>After some discussions with John we decided that we will publish together, hence it makes sense to now merge all that was authored together with John in branch “paperWJohn”.</p>
<p>We can do that by <em>merging</em> that branch with the master branch. Let’s try doing that:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> checkout master
$ <span class="kw">git</span> merge paperWJohn </code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>Auto-merging journal.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in journal.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</code></pre>
<p>Git cannot complete the merge because there is a conflict - if you recall, journal.txt differs in the same places (lines) in the master and the paperWJohn branch. We have to resolve the conflict and then complete the merge. We can get some more detail</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> status</code></pre>
<pre class="output"><code>On branch master
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run &quot;git commit&quot;)

Unmerged paths:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to mark resolution)

        both modified:      journal.txt</code></pre>
<p>Let’s look inside journal.txt:</p>
<pre><code>title
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
Laboratory measurements of atmospheric particle formation
=======
Simulations of atmospheric particle formation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; paperwjohn</code></pre>
<p>The mark-up shows us the parts of the file causing the conflict and the versions they come from. We now need to manually edit the file to resolve the conflict. This means removing the mark-up and doing one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keep the local version, which, here, is the one marked-up by HEAD i.e. “Laboratory measurements of atmospheric particle formation”</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the remote version, which, here, is the one marked-up by paperWJohn i.e. “Simulations of atmospheric particle formation”</p></li>
<li><p>Or manually edit the line to something new which might combine some elements of the two e.g. “Measurement-model comparison of atmospheric particle formation in laboratory experiments”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We edit the file. Then commit our changes:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">git</span> add journal.txt 
$ <span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Rewrite title to incorporate simulations&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>This is where version control proves itself better than DropBox or GoogleDrive, this ability to merge text files line-by-line and highlight the conflicts between them, so no work is ever lost.</p>
<h3 id="looking-at-our-history---revisited">Looking at our history - revisited</h3>
<p>We already looked at “going back in time with Git”. But now we’ll look at it in more detail to see how moving back relates to branches and we will learn how to actually undo things. So far we were moving back in time in one branch by checking out one of the past commits.</p>
<p>But we were then in the “detached HEAD” state.</p>
